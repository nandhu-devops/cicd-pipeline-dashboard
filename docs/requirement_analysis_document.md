# CI/CD Health Dashboard - Requirements Analysis Document

## Problem Statement
DevOps teams lack real-time visibility into CI/CD pipeline health across multiple repositories, leading to delayed incident response, poor deployment confidence, and inefficient resource allocation.

## Success Criteria
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Pipeline status updates within 30 seconds of completion
- **Alert Response**: Critical failures trigger notifications within 5 minutes
- **Dashboard Uptime**: 99.5% availability during business hours
- **User Adoption**: 80% of DevOps team uses dashboard daily within 3 months

## User Personas

### DevOps Engineer (Primary)
- **Goals**: Monitor pipeline health, troubleshoot failures, optimize build times
- **Pain Points**: Manual status checking, delayed failure notifications, poor visibility
- **Tech Level**: Advanced, comfortable with APIs and monitoring tools

### Squad Lead (Secondary)
- **Goals**: Team productivity overview, deployment confidence, resource planning
- **Pain Points**: Lack of team performance metrics, poor incident visibility
- **Tech Level**: Intermediate, prefers visual dashboards over raw data

## Scope

### In-Scope
- GitHub Actions workflow monitoring
- Real-time webhook processing
- Pipeline health metrics & alerts
- Historical run data & analytics
- Email/Slack notifications
- Role-based access control
- API for external integrations

### Out-of-Scope
- Jenkins/other CI providers
- Build artifact management
- Deployment orchestration
- Cost optimization
- Multi-cloud support
- Advanced analytics/ML

## Key Features & Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard
- **AC**: Displays all pipelines with real-time status, last run time, duration
- **AC**: Color-coded status indicators (green=success, red=failed, yellow=running)
- **AC**: Click-through to GitHub Actions run details

### 2. Real-time Alerts
- **AC**: Configurable alert rules (failure, slow builds, pipeline down)
- **AC**: Multiple notification channels (email, Slack, webhook)
- **AC**: Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking

### 3. Historical Analytics
- **AC**: 90-day retention of run data
- **AC**: Success rate trends, build time analysis
- **AC**: Exportable reports (CSV, JSON)

### 4. Webhook Integration
- **AC**: Secure GitHub webhook endpoint
- **AC**: Signature verification for security
- **AC**: Automatic pipeline discovery

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance (SLOs)
- **Latency**: API response < 200ms (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: Handle 1000+ webhooks/minute
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours

### Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with GitHub integration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (admin, user, read-only)
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with user context

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Ready for multiple instances

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for webhook processing
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring

## Tooling & Technology Choices

### Backend: FastAPI
- **Rationale**: Async-first, automatic OpenAPI docs, high performance
- **Alternatives Considered**: Django (too heavy), Flask (no async), Express.js (Python ecosystem preferred)

### Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind
- **Rationale**: Component-based architecture, fast development, utility-first CSS
- **Alternatives Considered**: Vue (smaller ecosystem), Angular (overkill), Svelte (immature)

### Database: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: ACID compliance, JSON support, mature ecosystem
- **Migration Path**: SQLite for development â†’ PostgreSQL for production

### Notifications: Slack + SMTP
- **Rationale**: Team collaboration, reliable delivery, webhook support
- **Alternatives Considered**: Teams (less integration), Discord (gaming focus)

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**
  - *Mitigation*: Implement exponential backoff, caching, multiple tokens

- **Data Loss**
  - *Mitigation*: Automated backups, point-in-time recovery, monitoring

### Medium Risk
- **Webhook Security**
  - *Mitigation*: Signature verification, IP whitelisting, audit logging

- **Performance Degradation**
  - *Mitigation*: Load testing, performance monitoring, auto-scaling

### Low Risk
- **User Adoption**
  - *Mitigation*: Training sessions, documentation, gradual rollout

## Assumptions

- GitHub Actions remains primary CI/CD platform
- Team size < 50 developers
- Single timezone operations
- Existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Network access to GitHub APIs and webhooks
- PostgreSQL expertise available

## Glossary

- **Pipeline**: Complete CI/CD workflow (build, test, deploy)
- **Workflow Run**: Single execution of a GitHub Actions workflow
- **Webhook**: HTTP callback for real-time event notifications
- **SLO**: Service Level Objective - measurable performance target
- **Alert**: Automated notification triggered by specific conditions
- **Correlation ID**: Unique identifier linking related log entries
